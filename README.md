## How to contribute
Fell free to contribute! Just a few useful information below.


This project use the Trunk-Based Development as source-control branching model. The usual workflow for contributing is the following:
1. create a new branch starting from `main` branch,
1. work on that,
1. create a pull request to merge the branch in the `main`.

Once the pull request is approved, please rebase the branch upon `main` and squash the commits before merging providing a meaningful commit message as follow:
```
Short (72 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.
